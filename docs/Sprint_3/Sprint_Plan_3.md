## Goal

- We want the user to be able to set up a musical toy with Smart Home functionality built into AVS kit.
- We want the user to be able to map a device and its capabilities using Rpi pins. 

## Task
  
- As a user, I want to be able to toggle my Adapted Musical Toy on/off using voice commands so I can control it despite my disability.
  - Task 1: Enable AVS functionality on the RPI. (~1 hour)
  - Task 2: Implement the ability on the Musical Toy to turn on or off using input from a switch we built.  (~5 hours)
  - Task 3: Implement the AVS Home Kit endpoint ToggleController for a mock device to be able to turn a LED on and off. This will use directives such as TurnOn and TurnOff.(~3 hours)
  - Task 4: Combine the switch created in task 2 with the AVS Home Kit endpoint in task 3. (~1 hour)

   Total Hours for User Story: ~10 Hours
 
- As a user, I want to be able to switch modes on my Alexa-Enabled Musical Toy so I can change the music using voice commands.
  - Task 1: Implement the ability on the Musical Toy to change to different songs by clicking on different switches that we built. (~5 hours).
  - Task 2: Implement the AVS Home Kit endpoint ModeController for a mock device. Implement the SetMode to switch on different LEDs on a breadboard to simulate different modes on the Musical Toy.(~3 hours)
  - Task 3: Combine the switches created in task 1 with the AVS Home Kit endpoint in task 2. (~ 1 hour)
  
  Total Hours for User Story: ~9 Hours
