## Task

- **User Story 1**: As a user, I want to be able to easily setup my RPI to know which device it is using some kind of system, without the user doing that much.
  - Task 1: Figure out a way for the device to identify itself the RPI, so the RPI knows what leads to use for each endpoint. (~5 hours)
- **User Story 2**: As a user, I want to be able to connect to my Wifi by using commands to the Alexa, so I don't need to stand up and do it myself.

  - Task 2: Implement way to connect to Wifi on RPI via a program. (~5 hours)
