## Actions to stop doing
- For now, we should stop all attempts at trying to get the RPI VM working with AVS. We have tried a variety of VMs like QEMU and VirtualBox. Neither VM worked with our situation.


## Actions to start doing
- We need to get everyone a Raspberry PI and make sure everyone has all the correct configurations already set up for the PI.
- We need to find a better way to delegate tasks, so there is not too much overlap with other teammates. It is very excessive to have the entire team working on one task.
- We find other solutions than having to depend on Flask-Ask, because it does not allow us much flexibility on the PI. Also, we should find a way that does require the PI to be both an Alexa cloud input and endpoint. This could be very negative to the performance of the device.
- Be more responsive on Slack
- Comminucate with others if you cannot make it to meetings
- Coding Sessions


## Actions to keep doing

- We should continue meeting every MWF, because it allows our team to make sure that everyone is on the same page.
- For those that have RPIs, they should keep working on their RPIs because those people will help the rest of the team catch up when the RPIs arrive. 
- We should still keep our Release Plan fluid in the future. This is so we can change it depending on when certain products (i.e. desk or toy) arrive.
- Researching
